## String matching

Given text $t$ (length $n$), find occurence(s) of string $s$ (length $m$) in it.

There are many ways to solve this problem. We provide comparison of some:

- Trivial: $O(nm)$
- Rabin-Karp algorithm (probabilistic matching): $O(n)$
- KMP and Z-algorithm: $O(n + m)$
  - Good for cases when there is a single pattern string
- Suffix trie: $O(m)$ but building the tree takes $O(n^2)$ time
- Suffix tree : $O(m + k)$
  where $k$ is the number of occurences of pattern.
- Suffix Array : $O(m \lg{n})$ with $O(n \lg{n})$ build time.
  - It is also possible to build suffix array in linear time.

### Rabin-Karp algorithm

This algorithm is based on calculating hash of all substrings
of $t$ of length $m$ and reporting a match if the hash matches that
of $s$.

To calculate hashes efficiently, it uses a *rolling* hash function.

> A rolling hash is a hash function where the input is hashed in a window that moves through the input.
> A few hash functions allow a rolling hash to be computed very quicklyâ€”the new hash value is rapidly calculated given only the old hash value, the old value removed from the window, and the new value added to the window

A simple rolling hash function is:
$$
f(s) = \left( \sum_{1 \le i \le n}{B^{n-i} s_i} \right) \bmod P
$$

Here $s$ is a string of length $n$ and $s_i$ denotes the numerical value
of character at index $i$. In practice, for a lowercase string, character $\text{a}$ is assigned value $0$
and $\text{z}$ is assigned $25$. The base $B = 26$ in such cases.
The modulus part controls the domain of output. Note that
lesser value of $P$ may result into higher number of collisions.

Now the important part is *rolling*, i.e. removing first value in window from hash
and adding a new value to window:

- Removing a value: let $s'$ be $s_{2, \ldots, n}$

  $$
  f(s') = (f(s) - B^{n-1} s_1) \bmod P
  $$

- Adding a value: let $s'$ be $s$ with one more character $s_{n+1}$

  $$
  f(s') = (Bf(s) + s_{n+1}) \bmod P
  $$

One may choose to verify, after hash value match, that the occurence is actually present.
In worst case this may result into $O(nm)$ time complexity.

### Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

KMP algorithm is based on prefix function which we will describe below.


Note: For a string $s$, let $s_{i,j}$ denote
substring starting at index $i$ and ending at $j$
(assume $1$ indexing).

#### Prefix function definition

For a string $s$ of length $n$, compute
an array $P$ of length $n$ such that $P_i$ gives
length of longest suffix of $s_{1,i}$ which
is also a prefix of $s$ (having length lesser than $i$)

> This is also called Knuth-Morris-Pratt prefix function
> or $\pi$ function

#### Ideas

Suppose we have already computed $P_1,\ldots,P_{i-1}$
and we want to compute $P_i$.

We have $P_i \le P_{i-1} + 1$. This is because, assume,
$P_i \gt P_{i-1} + 1$ and $P_i = k$ then we get
prefix of length $k-1$ as we move one index back to $i-1$. But $P_{i-1} \lt k - 1$ from
above assumption. Thus, the assumption is wrong.

The best we can get is $P_i = P_{i-1} + 1$
which requires $s_i = s_{P_{i-1} + 1}$.

What is the next maximum length we can get?

Suppose it is $P_i = l$ where $l \lt P_{i-1} + 1$. Then:
- Suffix of $s_{1,i}$ of length $l$ is also a prefix of $s$.
- Also, directly following from above, suffix of $s_{1,i-1}$ of length $l-1$
is also a prefix.
- But we also know that suffix of $s_{1,i-1}$ of length $P_{i-1}$ (note that $P_{i-1} \gt l-1$)
  is also a prefix.
- We have smaller instance of a problem, let $k = P_{i-1}$,
  then we need to find the largest suffix of $s_{1,k}$ which is also a prefix of $s$.
  We use already computed results: $P_{k} = l - 1 \Rightarrow l = P_k + 1$

We can repeat this process until we get to length $0$.

#### Algorithm

```
# assume string s of length N given
P = list of length N
P[1] = 0
for i = 2 to N
    j = P[i - 1]
    while j > 0 and s[j + 1] != s[i]
        j = P[j]
    if s[j + 1] = s[i]
        P[i] = j + 1
    else
        P[i] = 0
```

Note that $P_i \lt i$ $\forall$ $1 \le i \le n$ hence
the `while` loop making use of `j = P[j]` is guaranteed
to end.

To find time complexity, notice that:
- Due to `while` loop, `j` may decrease down to $0$ (and at least by $1$ per iteration).
- `P[i] = j + 1` and `j = P[i - 1]` means for the next iteration, value of `j` is
  increased by 1 (case where `P[i] = 0` means no increase)
- Since we can 'generate' value at most $n$ for `j` in all
iterations combined, we can decrease it at most the same amount (i.e., $n$ times)
without going negative.

Hence, time complexity is $O(n)$.

#### Implementation

```cpp
vector<int> prfunc (string s) {
  int n = s.size();
  vector<int> p(n, 0);
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int j = p[i - 1];
    while (j > 0 && s[j] != s[i]) j = p[j - 1];
    p[i] = (s[j] == s[i] ? 1 + j : 0);
  }
  return p;
}
```

Note:
- Due to $0$-indexing, `s[j] != s[i]` is used instead of `s[j + 1] != s[i]`
- For the same reason, `j = p[j - 1]` instead of `j = p[j]`

#### String matching using prefix function

Let the given text be string $t$ and pattern to match be $s$.

Then we can first compute prefix function $P$ for $s$.

We can then use a similar idea as prefix function.
For $t_{1, i}$ let largest suffix which is also a prefix
of $s$ is $k$. Then if $k = n$, we have a match for $s$ as $t_{i-n+1,i}$.

Let's look at a very similar algorithm
```
# s (length N), t (length M)
# assume P computed for s
  
1   j = 0
2   for i = 1 to M
3       while j > 0 and t[i] != s[j + 1]: j = p[j]
4       if t[i] != s[j + 1]: continue
5       j = j + 1
6       if j == N
7           output match starting at i - n + 1
8           j = p[j]
```

> Remember $j$ as length of longest suffix of $t_{1, i-1}$
> which is prefix of $s$.

Here $j$, at start iteration $i$, denotes the
length of longest prefix of $s$ (but not whole $s$) which also a suffix of $t_{1,i-1}$.
(or $0$ if $i = 1$).

If $t_i = s_{j+1}$, we extend that prefix to length $j+1$ otherwise
we find the next longest prefix satisfying the condition (making use of prefix function).

In line 4, `t[i] != s[j + 1]` there is no match possible, $j = 0$ in that
case and we move directly to next iteration.

In line 5, we do the extension to length $j+1$. Now, if
this length becomes $n$, then we output a match.
The last line finds the next longest prefix (because we can't take whole $s$).

For time complexity, we can apply the same argument (based on $j$)
as we did for prefix function. Time complexity is $O(m + n)$.

Implementation:
```cpp
vector<int> matches (string t, string s) {
  int m = t.size(), n = s.size();
  vector<int> p = prfunc(s);
  vector<int> ans;
  for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m; i++) {
    while (j > 0 && t[i] != s[j]) j = p[j - 1];
    if (t[i] != s[j]) continue;
    j++;
    if (j == n) {
      ans.push_back(i - n + 1);
      j = p[j - 1];
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
```

### Z-algorithm

Z-algorithm is based on Z-function which is similar to prefix function used in KMP.

For a string $s_{1,n}$, we wish
to compute array $z$ such that $z_i$
gives max $k$ such that $s_{1,k} = s_{i,i+k-1}$.

In other words, $z_i$ gives length of longest
prefix of $s$ that is also a prefix of $s_{i,n}$.

#### Computing Z-function trivially

```
s = "..."
z = [0, ...]

for i = 1 to n
    let x = 0
    while i + x <= n and s[1 + x] == s[i + x]
        x = x + 1
    z[i] = x
```

#### Matches

For each $i$ such that $z_i \gt 0$,
we have a string $s_{i, \ldots, i + z_i - 1}$
as a prefix of $s$.

Let $l = i$ and $r = i + z_i - 1$ then
$s_{l, \ldots, r}$ is a prefix of $s$.

We will get a $(l, r)$ pair for each $i$ where 
$z_i \gt 0$.

#### Using earlier matches

Suppose we are at index $i$ and we want to compute
$z_i$.

Suppose there is some $(l, r)$ from earlier matches ($1, \ldots, i-1$)
such that $r \ge i$. Then, visualize this:

```
abcdefgh_____________
____________abcdefgh
            l i    r
```

(letters only for representation, not reflecting actual values)

In this example, we know that:
- `s[l...r] = s[1...8] = abcdefgh`
- `s[i...r] = s[3...8] = cdefgh` (simple implication)

Suppose `z[3] = 5`, then we know that:
- `cdefg` is a prefix of `s`
- `cdefgh` is **not** a prefix of `s`

For `i`, can `z[i] > 5` ? Let's check whether `z[i] = 6`
- This would mean that `cdefgh` is a prefix of `s`
- But `s[3...8] = s[i...r] = cdefgh` and `z[3] = 5`
- Thus, `z[i] = 5`

Now, suppose `z[3] = 6`, then:
- `cdefgh` is a prefix of `s`
- `z[i] = 6` at least because we don't have
  knowledge of further letters.
- In this case we can explore trivially to check whether
  `z[i] > 6`.

In the algorithm, we will just re-use the information as presented.

#### Algorithm

- Assume $0$-indexing and $z$ of length $n$ being initialized with $0$
  and string $s$ of length $n$.

```
L, R = 0, 0
for i = 0 to n - 1:
    if i > R do:
        # Trivial calculation
        while (i + z[i] < n) and s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]
            z[i] += 1
        L, R = i, i + z[i] - 1
    else:
        k, len = i - L, R - i + 1
        if z[k] < len:
            z[i] = z[k]
        else:
            z[i] = len
            # Continue trivial calculation
            while (i + z[i] < n) and s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]
                z[i] += 1
            L, R = i, i + z[i] - 1
```

Time complexity can be shown as $O(n)$ on basis of `R` pointer.
Notice how in (and after) all the `while` loops, the number of iterations
equal increment of `R` (and `R` is never decremented and never exceeds $n$)

In implementation, we can do variable replacement to reduce code:
```py
def z_alg(s):
    n = len(s)
    z, l, r = [0] * n, 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i > r:
            l = r = i
            while r < n and s[r - l] == s[r]: r += 1
            z[i], r = r - i, r - 1
        elif z[i - l] < r - i + 1:
            z[i] = z[i - l]
        else:
            l = i
            while r < n and s[r - l] == s[r]: r += 1
            z[i], r = r - i, r - 1
    return z
```

Implementation in C++:
```cpp
vector<int> zcalc (string s) {
  int n = s.size(), l = 0, r = 0;
  vector<int> z(n, 0);
  auto calc = [&] (int l1, int r1, int i) {
      l = l1; r = r1;
      while (r < n && s[r - l] == s[r]) r++;
      z[i] = r - i; r--;
  };
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i > r) calc(i, i, i);
    else if (z[i - l] < r - i + 1) z[i] = z[i - l];
    else calc(i, r, i);
  }
  return z;
}
```
