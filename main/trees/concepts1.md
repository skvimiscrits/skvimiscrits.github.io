## Lowest common ancestor

In a rooted tree, lowest common ancestor of nodes $u_1, \ldots, u_n$
is a vertex at lowest level which occurs in path from $u_i$ to the root (for all $i$).

### LCA for pair of nodes

TODO - euler's tour and RMQ

### Illustration

You are given a tree with vertices $1$ to $n$. You will
be given queries of form $u, v$ and you have to answer the
distance between nodes $u$ and $v$.
